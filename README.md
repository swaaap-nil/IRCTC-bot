### Whats different?
It doesnot clicks buttons for you like other bots. ( built using Selenium etc ). I actually reverse engineered the api. The bot actually makes API requests with correct headers and payload just like the normal frontend site. It can auto solve captchas (using a microservice for OCR. See my other project for details).
